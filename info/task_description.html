        "di-dah di-di-di-dit di-dah-dah di-dah-dah-dah dah-di-dit dah-di-di-dah",
        sound of Morszelizer clanked out loud.<br><br>

        "What're you doing?" Nikola asked curiously.<br><br>

        "I'm sending our time logs for the last expedition to headquarters, but it's not an easy task..."
        Stephen grumbled, "Can you imagine that with all the computer power at our disposal,
        I STILL have to convert this message to Morse-code with only an on/off button... Hrmph... what a pain."
        He grumbled at the inconvenience.<br><br>

        "Let me look at it." Nikola offered his help, "It looks like a pretty easy solution, we could
        automate the process."<br><br>

        "Oh.. you hero of my day." Stephen started excitedly. "So, how do we start
        it?"<br><br>

        "With Python!" Nikola exclaimed.

    Help Stephen to create a module for converting a normal time string to a morse time string.
    As you can see in the illustration, a gray circle means on, while a white circle means off.
    Every digit in the time string contains a different number of slots.
    The first digit for the hours has a length of 2 while the second digit for the hour has a length of 4.
    The first digits for the minutes and seconds have a length of 3 while the second digits for the minutes and
    seconds have a length of 4.
    Every digit in the time is converted to binary representation.
    You will convert every on (or 1) signal to dash ("-") and every off (or 0) signal to dot (".").

<p>
    An time string could be in the follow formats: <em>"hh:mm:ss"</em>, <em>"h:m:s"</em> or <em>"hh:m:ss"</em>.
    The "missing" digits are zeroes. For example, "1:2:3" is the same as "01:02:03".
</p>
<div>
    The result will be a morse time string with specific format:
    <pre class="format" style="text-align: center;">"h h : m m : s s"</pre>
    where each digits represented as sequence of "." and "-"
</div>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A normal time string as a string (unicode).
</p>

<div>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The morse time string as a string.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Did you see the binary clocks task earlier?
    This is can be a fun gift for any geek.
    We tried to combine the old good Morse code with a binary clock in this task,
    and now you can create the new more complex binary clock,
    which doesn't show time -- but makes morse style bips and beeps. ;-)

<p>
    <strong>Precondition: </strong><br>
    <em>time_string</em> contains correct time.
